# Haveli_e_Khaas
I have created a landing page website called "Haveli-e-Khaas". 
Haveli-e-khaas literally means "Mansion of the Special" is a fictional, 
historical mansion that the now owners want to rent out to historians, 
shoots for advertisements, dramas and weddings. It is a fremarkable historical 
ancestral house that once belonged to a Mughal governor.

Please note that this website is created solely for educational purposes. 
However, if you wish to work on this project together or have any questions, let me know!
